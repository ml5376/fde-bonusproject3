# fde-bonusproject3

Bonus Project 3
The third bonus project is about implementing a K-Nearest-Neighbor algorithm for a directed graph and make it efficient.

Please find details about the task in this repository: https://gitlab.db.in.tum.de/fde/fde21-bonusproject-3

To work on the task:

Fork the project.
Set the visibility to private. Go to Settings -> Permissions and set Project visibility to Private. If you don't do this your submissions won't be accepted for the bonus, because everyone can see your implementation, use your tricks or copy your code.
Update team.txt with the same credentials you had in Bonus Project 1&2.

Submission
The repository is set up so that every commit that is pushed to gitlab is picked up by gitlab's continuous integration system. It will first run tests. If all tests pass, a performance evaluation stage is started. The timing result of this stage is submitted to contest.db.in.tum.de. All submissions which occurred in this way and execute in less than 2 minutes will be considered for the bonus. You are welcome to submit early and often. The runtime in the leaderboard will be the minimum runtime of all your submissions.



Deadline
11.02.22 23:59

All submissions before this date will be considered for the bonus.
